# WeatherApp

A simple and clean Weather Application built with Flutter, designed as a learning-focused project to understand API integration, asynchronous data handling, and dynamic UI updates.


# About the Project:

This project was developed to practice building a real-world Flutter application that consumes an external RESTful Weather API.
The app allows users to search for a city and retrieve its current weather data in real time.

The main motivation behind this project is to strengthen my understanding of API integration in Flutter and how mobile applications interact with external services.


# Objectives:

Learn how to create and structure a Flutter project properly

Integrate an external Weather API into a Flutter app

Send HTTP requests and handle responses

Parse JSON data and display it dynamically in the UI

Implement a search feature for city-based weather lookup

Handle user input errors (e.g. invalid city names)

Improve overall Flutter and Dart development skills
